        <h2> A bit about me</h2>
        <p>I am a new and learning web developer. I have been using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener refferer">Free Code Camp</a> to help me learn the basics of html, css, and javascript. 
        This portfolio page is the last project for their firt online certification in web development. I am hoping a find a entry-level job as either a junior web developer 
        or working with a CMS (Content Management System). I look forward to continue learning and growing in this field.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoying play video games. I have played many different genres but my favorite has been action role-playing games(ARPG).
            Grim dawn as been my most recent favorite, but I am currently looking forward to play Lost Ark when it releases for western audience in February 2022.
        </p>
        <p>With my background in computer programming and love for video games I do have an interest in video game development and the arts that go along with it. 
            I have learned 3D modeling with Blender, worked with small game projects using the Unity game engine and learn some C#. I am by no means an expert but do enjoying learning more 
            within these fields and expanding my skills.
