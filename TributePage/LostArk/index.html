            <h2>My thoughts</h2>
            <p>Overall the game is fine, but it is nothing groundbreaking. The combat is fun but simple and by no means challenging during the main storyline. Now the story I cannot really speak about
                as I have been skipping the dialoge and cutscenes as much as I can. I am more interested in getting to end game content and seeing if I truely enjoy the game. I cannot say I would reccommend the game
                unless you are just looking for something new to play.
