        <h2>About the game</h2>
        <p><b><em>Grim Dawn</em></b> is an action role-playing game (ARPG), developed and published

        <h2>My thoughts</h2>
        <p>I really enjoy this genre and this top down action role-playing 
            game (ARPG) is one of my favorites. The dual class system 
            offers a lot of customization for your character. For these kind of games I usually end up making plenty of 
            characters when I first start playing to see what I like and learn the game at the beginning. For Grim Dawn the 
            difficulty scales up gradually with normal being easy once you understand the game mechanics. 
            You can play on veteran from the start if you wish for a greater challenge right away, but once you 
            beat the base game storyline you unlock higher difficulties with that character giving you replayability. 
            Anyone who likes this genre of video games should give this one a try.
